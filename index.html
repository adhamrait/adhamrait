    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Auto-Regressive Conditional Generative Model</b> <br \>
        Implemented a generative model for multi-channel weather data using a conditional decoder. Modeled weather data using a variety of techniques, models, and architectures. Small model size enabled training for models accurate to 2 weeks in less than 5 minutes of training time and 30 seconds of prediction time.<br \>

        <b>Optimal Gaussian Process Kernel Choice</b><br \>
         Used gradient descent to choose the optimal kernel function for a Gaussian Process.
